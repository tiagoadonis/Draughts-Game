# Draughts-Game

The main goal for this project was to develop a draughts game using the WebGl API.  
Besides the capability of playing the 3D board model, you can do other operations, like:

- move it up, down, right or left;
- zoom in or zoom out;
- change the rendering mode to filled triangles, wireframes or vertices;
- change the projection type to persepective or ortogonal; 
- change the draughts colors;
- turn the board around the x, y or z axis, increasing or decreasing the rotation speed, or even change the rotation direction;
- restart the game;
- restart the view;
